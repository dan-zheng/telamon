Add UCT tree policy

This patch adds a new tree policy based on the UCT formula for selecting
children.

It also adds an `expandconfig` utility to load an explorer configuration file
and dump it with default values added.  `expandconfig` can also be used as a
guide to see available options in TOML syntax, and as a validator for existing
configuration files.

 * src/explorer/bandit_arm.rs:
	Add UCT policy implementation.  This also slightly changes the `Node`
	and `Edge` structures so that they only depend on the actual statistic
        structures used, not on the policy type.
 * src/explorer/config.rs:  Add UCT configuration options.
 * src/explorer/mod.rs:  Dispatch config to the proper policy.
 * src/bin/expandconfig.rs: Added.
 * Cargo.toml:  Add `expandconfig` utility.
